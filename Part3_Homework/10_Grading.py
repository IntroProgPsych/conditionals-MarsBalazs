# You are tasked with creating a simple grading system for a class. 
# Write a Python program that takes a student's score as input
#  and calculates and prints its corresponding letter grade based on the following grading scale:

# 90 or above: A
# 80-89: B
# 70-79: C
# 60-69: D
# Below 60: F
grade =int(input("Type your grade"))
if grade>=90 and grade <=100 :
    print('A')
elif grade>=80 and grade<=89:
    print('B')
elif grade>=70 and grade<=79:
    print('C')
elif grade>=60 and grade<=69:
    print('D')
elif grade<=60:
    print('F')
